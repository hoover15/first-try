	    <p>Trying some basic HTML and CSS to make what'll probably be a static page.</p>
		<p>Below is some thought process for getting the "About link" right onto the bottom of the page:</p>
		<br>
		<p>For the purposes of this page, the "position" element is what I needed to actually <em>position</em> the footer.</p>
		<p>Using the values of "absolute" and also using the "bottom" element to line the footer up solved my issues. This didn't take that long.</p>
		<p>I initially thought I needed to use a grid layout, but this website is simple enough to where that isn't necessary.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>It's very possible that this is a messy solution and adding more content to the page would require repositioning, which may end up being unnecessary effort for maintenance.</h3>
		<p>However, I am just starting out, and most importantly: <strong>It works.</strong></p>
