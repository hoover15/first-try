	    <p>Refreshing on some basic HTML and CSS to make what'll probably be a static page.</p>
		<p>Below is some thought process for getting the "About link" right onto the bottom of the page:</p>
		<br>
		<p>For the purposes of this page, the "position" property is what I needed to actually <em>position</em> the footer, as it turns out.</p>
		<p>Using a value of "absolute" solved my issues. This didn't take that long.</p>
		<p>I initially thought I needed to use a grid layout, but this website is simple enough to where that isn't necessary.</p>
		<p>I also used the "bottom" value for the div that contains the anchor element. However, this isn't a <em>valid value</em>; using the position preoperty is enough.
		<h3>This should allow the footer to always stay at the bottom of the page, even if more content is added that causes the page to end up scrolling.</h3>
		<p><strong>It works.</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>Where I am right now, I'm sure I'll get used to googling solutions for what are ultimately basic problems.</p>
		<p>The <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target-"_blank">MDN documentation</a> is a good resource if you also want to look up individual pieces of HTML and CSS. It also might be a good place to start learning web development.</p>
