	    <p>Trying some basic HTML and CSS to make what'll probably be a static page.</p>
		<p>Below is some thought process for getting the "About link" right onto the bottom of the page:</p>
		<br>
	    <p>To get the "About" footer on the bottom of the page, I DO have to use a grid layout?</p>
	    <p>I can make this whole page a three-row grid, with the header and footer being automatically sized. The section with paragraph text will take up a fraction of the available space.</p>
		<p>I DON'T HAVE TO use a grid layout. I am not getting the grid rows despite defining them and the footer does not automatically go to the bottom of the page??</p>
